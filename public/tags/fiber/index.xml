      <description>I found out recently that Utopia fired up the fiber in my neighborhood and I can get fiber internet. While a lot of people complain about Comcast my experience has been midling, not terrible and not great. I was fine up until I had a problem and had to tal to support, then it a was mightmarish.
So the question is if 10 gigabit/sec internet is too much bandwdith. I mean it isn&amp;rsquo;t really a question.</description>
