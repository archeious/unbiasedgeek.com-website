      <description>I have recently taken it upon myselft to learn Rust using Exercism.
It has been difficult as I already develop in Python (main language for my job), ruby (secondary, but probably actually primary language for my job), bash, Go, and C++. The languages all seem to blend into each other. Some of the langauges are used professionally and some as a hobby.</description>
