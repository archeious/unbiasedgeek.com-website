      <description>Work is getting rid of a bunch of servers. They had a 1 server per person order. I picked up a Dell R730xd for storage.
If they do not sell out I should be able to pick up more. I am hoping to replace all the R410s with R420s and get 3 R630s for a proper proxmox cluster.</description>

      <description>What do do when Ceph is taking its bloody time recovering. I am rebuilding my main hyperconverged cluster. Part of that is evacuating all the data from the old nodes. I took the OSD out of the cluster with ceph out osd.XX and the cluster started rebalancing. Unfortunately it taking forever, luckily I know how to fix it.
If we looks at the recovery settings, we will notice the max backfills and the max active are low.</description>
