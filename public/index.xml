      <description>I found out recently that Utopia fired up the fiber in my neighborhood and I can get fiber internet. While a lot of people complain about Comcast my experience has been midling, not terrible and not great. I was fine up until I had a problem and had to tal to support, then it a was mightmarish.
So the question is if 10 gigabit/sec internet is too much bandwdith. I mean it isn&amp;rsquo;t really a question.</description>

      <description>Work is getting rid of a bunch of servers. They had a 1 server per person order. I picked up a Dell R730xd for storage.
If they do not sell out I should be able to pick up more. I am hoping to replace all the R410s with R420s and get 3 R630s for a proper proxmox cluster.</description>

      <description>I have recently taken it upon myselft to learn Rust using Exercism.
It has been difficult as I already develop in Python (main language for my job), ruby (secondary, but probably actually primary language for my job), bash, Go, and C++. The languages all seem to blend into each other. Some of the langauges are used professionally and some as a hobby.</description>

      <description>What do do when Ceph is taking its bloody time recovering. I am rebuilding my main hyperconverged cluster. Part of that is evacuating all the data from the old nodes. I took the OSD out of the cluster with ceph out osd.XX and the cluster started rebalancing. Unfortunately it taking forever, luckily I know how to fix it.
If we looks at the recovery settings, we will notice the max backfills and the max active are low.</description>

      <description>What to do when Windows Linux Subsystem 2 decides to eat all your RAM. I left several WSL terminals running over night and when I returns I noticed my PC (that is a personal computer) was running slow. I checked the memory usuage and a process named vmmem was using nearly 32g. After a bit of research aka typing my problem into Google and clicking on the first LINK, I found out that vmmem is the process that handles the system resources of the virtual machine WSL2 runs in.</description>
