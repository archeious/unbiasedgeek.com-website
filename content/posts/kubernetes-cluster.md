# Setting up an "Enterprise" grade Kubernetes cluster for personal use.

First off, why would any one want to do such a thing.  My simple answer to that is, because I can.  The longer more
involved answer is that I want to keep up with current trends without having to worry about causing downtime at work.  
Many people have hobbies.  It can be fly fishing, crotcheting, rock climbing; mine is building and maintaining enterprise 
grade tech solutions at hone.

In fact the purpose of this post is solely to create a new post, to go into a new container image, which will trigger a 
new deployment.
