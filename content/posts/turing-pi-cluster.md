# The Big Small or is it the Small Big
## Single Board Cluster 

A while back I backed the Turing Pi 2 kickstarter.  It has issue and the rPi community at large had supply chain issues.  
That being said I totally forgot about the project.  I was recently digging through some old boxes and came across the 
boards, whereas the supply chain issues seem to be resolved and the Turing Pi 2 boards are Jetson compatible I decided 
to order up some of the Turing RK1 compute modules.  The idea is to have 3xRK1s and 1 nVidia Jetson (for the AIs) boards.
