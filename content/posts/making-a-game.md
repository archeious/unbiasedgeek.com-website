# I am starting a new project to keep my skills sharp.  
I have been in a rut lately and I wanted to "sharpen my axe".  **Just** watching video tutorials or howto blogs
may scratch that itch to learn, it doesn't actually do much for internalizing it.  I made a list of reason to 
a game as the skeleton to hang this learning on.

* I LIKE GAMES

It isn't a long list but it is effective.  My though is that I need something to keep me engaged.  The project
will actually be a series of games, the type of games I loving call shovelware.  aka It is not meant to be a 
pull fledged game.  It is not meant to be fun for anyone else.  It is meant to keep me entertained while I learn.

The first game will be a small farm simulator.  A very simple cross between The Sims and Stardew Valley.  There 
will be a farm (grid of dirt squares).  You, as the player, will mark what needs to be done. e.g., Water the 
crops, Plant seeds, Harvest the plants.  Then an NPC will do it.  The goal it learn A-Star pathfinding.

This first game will use the Godot game engine and use the built in scripting language.
