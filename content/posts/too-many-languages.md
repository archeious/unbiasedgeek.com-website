+++

I have recently taken it upon myselft to learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) using [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust/exercises).  
It has been difficult as I already develop in Python (main language for my job), ruby (secondary, but probably actually primary language for my job), bash, Go, and C++.  The languages all seem to blend into each other.
Some of the langauges are used professionally and some as a hobby.
