# A ~~triumphant~~ medicore return.

I has been ages since I posted anything.  It wasn't until I was putting together some material on **GitOps** that I even remembered about the site.

Well, I am back.  I don't have anything in particular to post.  Think of this as a NOP to properly align the code segment for a more optimized run in the future.
