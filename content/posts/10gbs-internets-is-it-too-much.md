title = "10gbs Internets Is It Too Much"
+++
I found out recently that Utopia fired up the fiber in my neighborhood and I can get fiber internet.  While a lot of people complain
about Comcast my experience has been midling, not terrible and not great.  I was fine up until I had a problem and had to tal to 
support, then it a was mightmarish.


So the question is if 10 gigabit/sec internet is too much bandwdith.  I mean it isn't really a question.  Of course I am going to 
get it.  I am aware that I will only actually get around 2-3g/s in actual bandwidth and far less depending on the other end of the 
pipe.  I will also be honest in admitting I want it just to say I have it.  The same reason I have a full scale rack and a plethora 
of servers.
